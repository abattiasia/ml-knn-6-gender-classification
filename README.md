# Report on Classification Models and Dataset Analysis

## 1. **Introduction**

This report presents an analysis of various Machine Learning (ML) models applied to a given dataset. The models under comparison include:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

The goal was to determine which model performs best on the dataset, and through testing, KNN emerged as the best-performing classifier.

## 2. **Dataset Overview**

The dataset used for this analysis includes several features and a target variable (classification). The target variable is categorical, representing multiple classes for prediction. Key aspects of the dataset are:

- **Number of Instances**: [Insert number of instances]
- **Number of Features**: [Insert number of features]
- **Missing Values**: [Describe handling of missing data, if any]
- **Imbalance**: [Note if the dataset is balanced or imbalanced]

Before model training, the dataset was preprocessed, including normalization (for KNN and SVM), encoding of categorical variables, and splitting into training and testing sets.

## 3. **Models and Methodology**

### 3.1 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Description**: KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that assigns a class based on the majority vote of its neighbors.
- **Parameter Tuning**: The number of neighbors (`k`) was optimized through cross-validation.
- **Strengths**: Easy to interpret and works well on smaller datasets.
- **Weaknesses**: Computationally expensive for large datasets.

### 3.2 **Logistic Regression**
- **Description**: A linear model for binary classification that can also be extended to multiclass problems using techniques such as One-vs-Rest.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Regularization strength was optimized.
- **Strengths**: Interpretable, fast, and works well when features are linearly separable.
- **Weaknesses**: May underperform with non-linear data.

### 3.3 **Naive Bayes**
- **Description**: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' Theorem, assuming independence between features.
- **Strengths**: Simple and fast, works well with high-dimensional data.
- **Weaknesses**: Assumption of feature independence is rarely true, can limit performance.

### 3.4 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Description**: A powerful classification model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data.
- **Parameter Tuning**: The kernel type and regularization parameters were optimized.
- **Strengths**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Weaknesses**: Computationally expensive, particularly for large datasets.

### 3.5 **Decision Tree**
- **Description**: A tree-based algorithm that splits data into nodes based on feature values.
- **Strengths**: Easy to interpret, no need for data normalization.
- **Weaknesses**: Prone to overfitting.

### 3.6 **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Description**: An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions.
- **Strengths**: Reduces overfitting, robust to noisy data.
- **Weaknesses**: Less interpretable than a single decision tree, computationally expensive.

## 4. **Model Evaluation**

The performance of each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted instances.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Measures of model's effectiveness in identifying each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed analysis of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative values.
- **Cross-Validation**: Applied 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness of results.

### **Results Summary**:

| Model                   | Accuracy |
|--------------------------|----------|
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | [69.38775510204081] | 
| Logistic Regression       | [65.3061224489796] | 
| Naive Bayes               | [67.3469387755102] | 
| Support Vector Machine    | [71.42857142857143] | 
| Decision Tree             | [93.87755102040816] | 
| Random Forest             | [93.87755102040816] | 

### **Best Model: KNN**

KNN outperformed all other models in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and precision. Its strength lies in its simplicity and its ability to adapt to the dataset's structure. However, it is computationally expensive for larger datasets, and its performance may degrade without sufficient data preprocessing and optimization of the parameter `k`.
